# Used Car Prices Prediction

Predicting used car prices using machine learning.


## Description
This project develops a predictive model to estimate used car prices based on characteristics, aiding buyers and sellers. Machine learning algorithms analyze relationships between car features and market prices.


## Problem Statement
Develop a model to predict used car prices from specification data.


## Technologies Used
1.  Python (3.9+)
2.  Pandas (1.4+)
3.  NumPy (1.22+)
4.  Scikit-learn (1.1+)
5.  TensorFlow (2.9+, optional)
6.  Jupyter Notebooks
7.  Matplotlib (3.5+), Seaborn (0.11+) for visualization
8.  LightGBM, XGBoost for boosted trees


## Methodologies
1.  Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization.
2.  Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features (e.g., age, mileage).
3.  Modeling: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
4.  Evaluation: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared.


## Usage
1.  Clone repository.
2.  Install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3.  Run notebooks sequentially.


## Key Features
1.  Data exploration, visualization.
2.  Model comparison, selection.
3.  Hyperparameter tuning.
4.  Feature importance analysis.
