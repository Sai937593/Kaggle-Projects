# Obesity Classification

Classifying obesity levels using machine learning.


## Description
This project predicts obesity levels based on individual characteristics, facilitating targeted health interventions. Machine learning algorithms analyze relationships between demographic, lifestyle and health data.


## Problem Statement
Develop a model to classify obesity levels from survey data.


## Technologies Used
1.  Python (3.9+)
2.  Pandas (1.4+)
3.  NumPy (1.22+)
4.  Scikit-learn (1.1+)
5.  TensorFlow (2.9+, optional)
6.  Jupyter Notebooks
7.  Matplotlib (3.5+), Seaborn (0.11+) for visualization


## Methodologies
1.  Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization.
2.  Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features.
3.  Modeling: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM.
4.  Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.


## Usage
1.  Clone repository.
2.  Install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3.  Run notebooks sequentially.


## Key Features
1.  Data exploration, visualization.
2.  Model comparison, selection.
3.  Hyperparameter tuning.
4.  Feature importance analysis.
