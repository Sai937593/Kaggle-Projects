# Loan Approval Prediction

Predicting loan approval using machine learning.

## Description
This project develops a predictive model to determine loan approval based on applicant characteristics, enhancing lending decision-making. It utilizes machine learning algorithms, exploring relationships between applicant data and loan outcomes.

## Problem Statement
Develop a model to predict loan approval based on applicant information.
